## What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

1. Understanding
2. Planning
3. Dividing and conquering

## Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

Because you can't solve something you don't understand. Or you won't know when you've successfuly solved the problem and may have been wasting time on the wrong solution.

## What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

- Translate the problem into pseudocode.
- Divide the problem into smaller problems.

## What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

- Ask yourself some questions such as:
    * Does your program have an UI?
    * What inputs will your program have?
    * What is the desired output?
    * What are the steps necessary to the desired output given your inputs?

## What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is like a recipe, a series of steps that you have to go through to perform a task.

## What is pseudocode?

Pseudocode is writing the logic of the program in natural language.

## What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

- It won't be overwhelming.
- Focus on specific tasks.
- Avoid the complexity.
- Make the problem easier.
- At the end you can connect all the pieces together to solve the problem.
